# grunt-bower-install

> Inject your Bower dependencies right into your HTML from Grunt.

## What is this?
[Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) is great.

[Bower](http://bower.io) is great.

**And now they work great together.**

`grunt-bower-install` is a Grunt plug-in, which finds your components and injects them directly into the HTML file you specify.

Whether you're already using Bower and Grunt, or new to both, `grunt-bower-install` will be easy to plug in, as you will see in the steps below.

_**do note**: Bower is still a young little birdy, so things are changing rapidly. Authors of Bower components must follow certain conventions and best practices in order for this plug-in to be as accurate as possible. It's not a perfect world out there, so needless to say, some Bower components may not work as well as others._

## Getting Started

*If you are new to Grunt, you will find a lot of answers to your questions in their [getting started guide](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started).

To install the module:
```
npm install grunt-bower-install-shopware --save-dev
```

Include the task in your Gruntfile:
```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-bower-install-shopware');
```

Create a config block within your Gruntfile:
```js
'bower-install': {
  // Point to the html file that should be updated
  // when you run `grunt bower-install`
  html: 'app/index.html',

  // Optional:
  // If your scripts shouldn't contain a certain
  // portion of a url, it can be excluded
  ignorePath: 'app/'
}
```

Pop this in your HTML file:
```html
<!-- bower -->
<!-- endbower -->
```

Install a Bower component:
```
grunt bower-install:jquery
```

You're in business!
```html
<!-- bower -->
<script src="bower_components/jquery/jquery.js"></script>
<!-- endbower -->
```

If you want to uninstall a Bower component:
```
grunt bower-uninstall:jquery
```

## Behind the Scenes
This plug-in decorates the native Bower commands. So, by saying `grunt bower-install:jquery`, you are really saying:

```
bower install jquery --save
```

After the Bower command finishes executing, this plug-in will take a look at all of the components you have, and determine the best order to inject your scripts in to your HTML file.

Putting script tags that aren't managed by `grunt-bower-install` is not advised, as anything between `<!-- bower -->` and `<!-- endbower -->` will be overwritten with each command.
